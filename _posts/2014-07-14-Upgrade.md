title: Major Upgrade to Report System – Friday 18th July 2014
---

Thanks for all your feedback. Following nearly a year's experience we have made significant improvements to the system for creating and filling out survey reports. This brand new  "template engine" has two main aims:
Easier report completion for surveyors with automatic saving and easier filling out of reports - now each field is validated and then saved after input. Surveyors can have confidence each field is saved after it has been entered avoiding the risk of losing work
The ability to create better lender report templates with improved layouts
Inevitably such a significant upgrade involves some disruption. Therefore, please note that the Surventrix system will be unavailable from 18:00 on Friday 18th July to 08:00 on Monday 21st July.  

**It is vital that you complete any reports you have started this week by 18:00 on Friday. If you don’t think you can complete a report please do not start it but, rather, leave it until Monday.**

It will not be possible to re-open "old" reports in the new system but you will still be able to view and download the “old” reports as PDFs.

We will be monitoring the system to quickly address any issues promptly.

Thanks once again for your support.
