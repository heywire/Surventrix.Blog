title: New Report Writer
---

We have successfully migrated our templates to a new and improved system.

This means reports are now easier to fill out and the flexibility in our templates
have improved massively.

If you do experience any issues please do contact us at support@surventrix.com
so we can address those issues for you.

Just a reminder that any uncompleted reports before this weekend will have some
data missing, so make sure to check your reports, and they may need to be filled
out again.
