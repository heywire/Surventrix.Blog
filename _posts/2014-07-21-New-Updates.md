title: New Report Writer
---

We have successfully migrated our templates to a new and improved system.

This means reports are now easier to fill out and the flexibility in our templates
have improved massively.

If you do experience any issues please do contact us at support@surventrix.com
so we can address those issues for you.

Just a reminder that any uncompleted reports before this weekend will have some
data missing, so make sure to check your reports, and they may need to be filled
out again.

- Once you have click enter on a field from the drop down, you will open up a
  dialog box in which you can fill out your input. Note all fields are saved
  one field at a time, you can fix any issues at that moment.

You can also open up the field dialog by clicking on the field in the report. A
field may be filled out already and in yellow, or you will see a little space
with a yellow background, clicking on the field will open up the field dialog.
